#Color pallete, inspired by PlotSquared, take a look at it! Best plot plugin ever 10/10 would use again.
 #These are colors which you can use and modify however you like :D
 #They are very useful when "designing" chat appearrence, because any 
 #change you make to them will update on all the messages
 #They were made to make messages easier to customize.
 #If you can't remember which is which, try this:
 # Use $1 on messages about ALL the mines
 # Use $2 on messages about a single mine
 # Use $3 on simple messages / The one who no one ever reads
 # Use $4 on warning/error messages, I believe red would be the better
 # for this, but I won't stop from putting that bright shiny and beautiful pink color on warnings :D
 
 # And of course you don't need to use global colors at all, you still use '&a', thats fine :)
 
 #Actual color pallete below
 # This is $1
 primaryColor: "e"
 # This is $2
 secondaryColor: "a"
 # This is $3
 neutralColor: "7"
 # This is $4
 warningColor: "c"
 
#Cool tags 360 no scope

# %prefix% - Replaced by messagePrefix (The one right below)
# %separator% - Replaced by messageSeparator
#
# %mine% - Replaced by the mine name (Usable only on Mine messages!)
