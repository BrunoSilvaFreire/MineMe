#Color pallete, inspired by PlotSquared, take a look at it! Best plot plugin ever 10/10 would use again.
 #These are colors which you can use and modify however you like :D
 #They are very useful when "designing" chat appearrence, because any 
 #change you make to them will update on all the messages
 #They were made to make messages easier to customize.
 #If you can't remember which is which, try this:
 # Use $1 on messages about ALL the mines
 # Use $2 on messages about a single mine
 # Use $3 on simple messages / The one who no one ever reads
 # Use $4 on warning/error messages, I believe red would be the better
 # for this, but I won't stop from putting that bright shiny and beautiful pink color on warnings :D
 
 # And of course you don't need to use global colors at all, you still use '&a', thats fine :)
 
 #Actual color pallete below
 # This is $1
 primaryColor: "e"
 # This is $2
 secondaryColor: "a"
 # This is $3
 neutralColor: "7"
 # This is $4
 warningColor: "c"
 

 #This is the preset that will be setup to all the mines if forceHologramOnAllMines is enabled
 #
 #Cool tags 360 no scope
 # ----- Global tags (Always replaced) -----
 # %prefix% - Replaced by messagePrefix (The one right below)
 # %separator% - Replaced by messageSeparator
 # %header% - Replaced by pluginHeader
 #
 # ----- Mines tags (Will only be replaced on Mine messages) -----
 # %mine% - Replaced by the mine -> NAME <-
 # %alias% - Replaced by the mine -> ALIAS <-
 #
 # Just a little note about mined and remaining blocks:
 # - They only count when first broken
 # - If you place a block in a mine it will not count as a "extra block"
 # - If you break a block in a mine it and put another one in it's place, it will count as a mined block, the placed block does NOT count
 # - If you break a block in a mine it and put another one and break it again, it will NOT count, you can't ~farm mined blocks~
 # - Explosion counts.
 # - World Edit counts.
 # %composition:(Material name here)% - Replaced the percentage of the material in the mine's composition, returns 0 if the mine doesn't contains the material
 # example: %composition:STONE% Get the Stone percentage in the mine's composition
 #
 # %volume% - Replaced by the mine's volume
 # %minedblocks% - Replaced by the number of mined blocks
 # %minedblockspercent% - Replaced by the percentage of mined blocks
 # %remainingblocks% - Replaced by the number of remaining blocks
 # %remainingblockspercent% - Replaced by the percentage of remaining blocks
