#Colors
 #The are colors which you can use and modify however you like :D
 #These were made to make messages easier to customize.
 #Try to remember those like this:
 # Use $1 on messages about ALL the mines
 # Use $2 on messages about a single mine
 # Use $3 on simple messages / The one who no one ever reads
 # Use $4 on warning/error messages, I believe red would be the better
 # for this, but I won't stop from putting that bright shiny and beautiful pink color on warnings :D
 
 # And of course you don't need to use global colors at all, you still use '&a', thats fine :)
 
 # This is $1
 primaryColor: "e"
 # This is $2
 secondaryColor: "a"
 # This is $3
 neutralColor: "7"
 # This is $4
 warningColor: "c"
 
#Messages

    messagePrefix: "&e&lMine&a&lMe"
    messageSeparator: " &6&l> $3"
    resetMessage: "$2The mine %mine% has been reseted!"
